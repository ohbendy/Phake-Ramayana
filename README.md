# Phake Ramayana Unicode font

This repo contains **Phake Ramayana Unicode** font and a log of the issues discussed in its production.

This font is designed to support the following languages using Myanmar Unicode characters:

- Tai Phake 
- Tai Aiton
- Tai Khamyang
- Tai Turung
- Tai Khamti

It is based on a non-Unicode version created by Stephen Morey between 1997 and 2000, inspired by the Lama Mang or Phake Ramayana manuscript. The font has been completely redrawn, rescaled and re-engineered by Ben Mitchell in 2021. As a result of manuscript studies, this update has also included additions to the character set and some new ligatures. We are grateful to Chow Kensan Tunkhang for his knowledge of the script and for providing excellent handwritten samples.

We plan to open-source this once we're satisfied the glyph shapes and behaviour are acceptable.

### Changelog ###
29-05-24 v0.3 Added ligature of medialYa_iMark and an alternate .narrow version when followed by narrow consonants with a mark above. Some spacing and positioning adjustments. Added narrow version of aiMark-aiton to avoid certain collisions.
