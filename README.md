# Phake-Ramayana

This repo currently contains only issues where we can discuss questions privately. In the future we may decide to host the source files for the font here and perhaps the compiled binary font file. We could also publish the font here for people to use, if we agree what licence is appropriate. That way users could also raise issues for us to improve the font.
