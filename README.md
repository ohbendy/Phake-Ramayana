# Phake-Ramayana

This repo currently contains a prototype version of the PhakeRamayanaUnicode font and a log of the issues discussed in its production. In the future we could also open the repository for public access, if we agree what licence is appropriate (MIT?). That way users could also raise issues for us to improve the font.
